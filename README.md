- 'npm test'

# Challenge Summary

- Implement a Hash-table with the following methods:

1. add: takes in both the key and value.
2. get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
3. contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
4. hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.


## Challenge Description

- I need to simulate how hash tables works , using an array in a place of the memory and using a hash method to hash the key , then using the linked list to solve the collision issue .

## Approach & Efficiency

- i build HashTable class with all require methods , using linked list to solve the collision issue .

## Big O notation

O(n)
