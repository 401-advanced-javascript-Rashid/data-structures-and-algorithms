# Code Challenge // linked-list-insertions
Insertion of linked list
So, the steps to be followed are as follows: Make a new node. Point the 'next' of the new node to the 'head' of the linked list. Mark new node as 'head'.
__________

- These three possibilities are:
- Insertion at the beginning of the list.
- Insertion at the end of the list.
- Inserting a new node except the above-mentioned positions.

## Challenge

i need to make a Fake linked-list. show that i can make an empty list, that i can insert into the list, the head will point to the first node, i can insert multiple nodes into the list, will return true if value within the list exists, will return false when searching for a value in the list that does not exist, and will return a collection of values that exists in the linked list.
