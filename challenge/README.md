# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

- Implement a Hash-table with the following methods:

1. add: takes in both the key and value.
2. get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
3. contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
4. hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.


## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- I need to simulate how hash tables works , using an array in a place of the memory and using a hash method to hash the key , then using the linked list to solve the collision issue .


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- i build HashTable class with all require methods , using linked list to solve the collision issue .


## Big O notation
- Space	 Worst case  O(n)
- Search Worst case	O(n)
- Insert Worst case	O(n)
- Delete Worst case	O(n)
